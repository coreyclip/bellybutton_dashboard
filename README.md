## Background
This project combines a flask backend with D3.js data visualizations to create an expressive and responsive webdashboard. 
The data is drawn from the [Belly Button Biodiversity DataSet](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/) which
documents the number and variety of microrganisms found in over 100 subject bellies. 

## Aim
Demostrate how python-flask can service routes delivering data to js scripts within a DOM.
